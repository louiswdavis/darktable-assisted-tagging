# Roadmap

Ideas worth doing deliberately later, not bolted onto whatever's being fixed today.

## Generalize beyond motorsport

`Entry` (`match.py`), the OCR number lookup, and the "team" tie-break in `match_box`
are motorsport-specific. The underlying pipeline — detect → crop → embed (DINOv2) →
match against a collection's reference crops → burst consensus — is already
domain-agnostic (`vehicles.py`, `embed.py`, `reference_store.py`).

Other domains that would fit the same pipeline with different identifying
attributes instead of race number / team:

- **Other sports** (jersey number stands in directly for race number)
- **People** — no number; livery embedding alone, maybe swapped for a face-embedding model
- **Landmarks** — no number, no "team" grouping concept at all
- **Flowers / birds / animals** — species/genus grouping could replace "team"
  (e.g. a "same species, can't tell which individual" tie-break)

Needs a schema redesign (`Entry` fields become domain-specific, or a pluggable
"identifying attribute" concept) rather than reusing `number`/`team` as-is.

### Proposed shape: per-collection workflow type

Rather than one generic `Entry` schema stretched to cover every domain, give each
collection a `workflow` (or `type`) field — similar in spirit to how
darktable-assisted-culling selects an action type — that determines:

- which `Entry` fields are valid/required (e.g. `number`+`team` for motorsport,
  nothing but an id for landmarks, `species` instead of `team` for
  flowers/birds/animals)
- which embedding/matching model the pipeline uses (DINOv2 crop-embedding stays
  the default; people may need a face-embedding model instead)
- which tie-break logic `match_box` applies when a crop is ambiguous (team
  tie-break for motorsport, species tie-break for animals, no tie-break at all
  for landmarks)

A collection's `entries.json` would declare its `workflow` once at the top level;
`match.py`/`vehicles.py` would dispatch on it rather than assuming motorsport
fields exist. The OCR number-matching path (`match.py`) stays motorsport-only and
is simply absent for workflows that don't declare it.

Scope this as its own task once the motorsport pipeline (current F1 fix, `Number
seen` diagnostic, in-panel editor) is tested and stable — don't bolt it onto the
in-progress work.

## Smaller known gaps

- "Edit entries.json" button prints a mangled path instead of opening/editing the
  file when `open_in_app` fails on Windows — consider an in-app darktable dialog
  with a text-entry widget instead of relying on the OS file association.
